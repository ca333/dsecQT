### Project Status ###

Currenly komodo-qt is *under developement*. Use it at your own risk - do not use for mining or merchant applications, also we don't recommend now to use it with your main wallet. Before use you can copy your main wallet.dat in a secure place or use `-datadir` command-line key to select other data folder for use with komodo-qt.

- OS Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10 (**64-bit**)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Version 14.0.25431.01 Update 3
- CMake 3.10.2 ([cmake-3.10.2-win64-x64.msi](https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/cmake-3.10.2-win64-x64.msi)), add it to system path for all users during install.
- Qt 5.9.2 ([qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.9.2.exe](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.9/5.9.2/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.9.2.exe))
- [Far Manager v3.0 build 5100 x64](https://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en) (not necessary, but very convenient to use command line and execute commands)

**1.** Download and install all needed software. Qt should be installed into it's default path `C:\Qt\Qt5.9.2` . 

**1a.** Don't forget to select `msvc2015 64-bit` component during install:

**2.** Clone sources repository using `git clone https://github.com/ip-gpu/KomodoOcean` or `git clone https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean` .

**3.** Make sure that you are on Windows (master) branch `git checkout master` .

**4.** Unpack the content of `KomodoOcean\depends\depends.zip` archive in `KomodoOcean\depends` folder:

**5.** Launch Qt Creator and choose Open Project. Navigate to `KomodoOcean` directory and open `KomodoOceanGUI.pro` project file.

**5a.** Make sure that Build directory in Projects -> Build Settings corresponds to your project path (for example `C:\Distr\KomodoOcean`, this is a folder in which we clone repo).

**6.** Select Build -> Build Project "KomodoOceanGUI" from Top Menu or press Ctrl-B to start build.

**7.** After build is finished you will see ```KomodoOceanGUI.exe``` in ```release``` folder.

Congratulations! You built Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean) for Windows. Now you can run it. 

### Dependencies ###

This repo has prebuilt version (`rustzcash.lib`) of [librustzcash](https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash) library. If you want to build it by yourself, follow next steps:

**1.** [Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) Rust language for Windows, you'll need [x86_64-pc-windows-msvc](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe) version. 

**2.** Add `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` in `%PATH%` environment variable after install.

**3.** If you have https -> ssh substitution in your `.gitconfig`, like :

	[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
	insteadOf = https://github.com/

You'll need to add following lines in `.cargo/config` file:

    [net]
    git-fetch-with-cli = true
    
To get rust work correctly with ssh connection, otherwise you will have "error authenticating: failed connecting agent; class=Ssh (23)" and "attempted ssh-agent authentication, but none of the usernames `git` succeeded" errors, during download rust deps.

If you don't set-up any substitutions https -> ssh for git earlier, no additional actions required.

**4.** Clone librustzcash repo and build library:

    git clone https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash
    cd librustzcash
    cargo build # to build debug version
	cargo build --release  # to build release version

Your `*.lib` will be available in `target/(release/debug)` folders relatively.
